Application Framework base package: it loads and applies packages to the application object.

I was and still am a big fan of LEGOÂ® and I would like to think that software development should work in the same way.
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) is a great piece box and if we use prototype-less patterns (mixins, ...) we could apply behaviours to our applications
by expressing them as dependencies...

Example, my application should:

- emit events (install [application.mixin.emitter](https://github.com/luscus/application.mixin.emitter))
- be a state machine (install [application.mixin.automaton](https://github.com/luscus/application.mixin.automaton))
- use network communication (install [application.module.socket](https://github.com/luscus/application.module.socket) and any available protocol package)

This way I don't need to implement all this stuff or write code to use libraries: the behaviour is instantly available in the application object.
I can focus on the application specific code.


## Plugin types

### Mixin

Mixins add behaviours to the base application object itself: package name prefix is `application.mixin.`

### module

Modules wrap functionalities related to some specific domain into one property of the base object: package name prefix is `application.module.`

## Usage

## Set Dependency

    npm install application.skeleton

## Configuration

You can optionally pass a configuration that will be stored in the application object in a `config` property.

The structure of the config is up to you and your project, however there is one limitation: `config.modules` is reserved.
This config property is used to set configuration options for modules.

    var config = {
      "prop1": "someValue",
      "prop2": "whatever",
      modules: {
        "application.module.socket": {
          "enableThis": true,
          "portRange": [25000, 25100]
        }
      }
    };

## Initialise

    var skeleton = require('application.skeleton');

    // load plugins
    skeleton(application, config);
